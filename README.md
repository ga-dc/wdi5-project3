# Project 3

## Your mission:

Make something.

This is your chance to be really creative and create something that's completely **yours**. This should be considered a portfolio piece.

## Hard Requirements

- It must be a Rails app.
- It must incorporate AJAX. Bear in mind that doesn't *necessarily* mean using an external API.
- You must include at least 5 user stories.

## Checkpoints

#### Due Friday, Week 8

Write a brief overview of your current idea, and 5 corresponding user stories.

Then, create a new repository for your project. This evening's overview and user stories, and all subsequent planning notes, documentation, photos of ERDs, and any other evidence of your thought process should be included in this repository. 

Finally, post the link to your repository as an issue on the wdidc5-project3 repository:

https://github.com/ga-dc/wdidc5-project3

#### Due Monday, Week 9

On Monday you will meet individually with an instructor to review your progress. Have something to show them.

#### Wednesday, Week 9

We'll meet at 9:00am, as classes, for a stand-up to gauge progress.

#### Friday, Week 9

**Please be on-campus at 1:00pm.** You will present your completed product. Presentations will be Science Fair-style, as with Project 1. 

## Other 

- Can we work together?
  - The projects must be individual. However, you are more than welcome to seek help and inspiration from your classmates and instructors.
- I can't think of an idea!
  - To start off with, you might think of a problem you run into on a recurring basis, or a time you've found yourself thinking, "Man, I wish this existed," or, "Man, this is so inefficient." Necessity is the mother of invention. Many of the most popular apps and programs have been invented as a result of someone being ticked off by something that did or didn't exist. Feel free to ask your instructors for help!

## Work schedule

You are welcome to work outside of GA at your own pace this week. We will be meeting on *Wednesday at 9:00am* for a stand-up to gauge progress, after which you will be free to work as you please again. Keep in mind: if you know that you will be distracted working elsewhere, then work here. The instructors will be at GA each day from 8:30 to 5:30, as usual.
